## Projects

### 1. [**Analyzing Customer Churn with Tableau**](https://github.com/nalapalu/Tableau_Projects/tree/main/Analysing-Customer-Churn-with-Tableau)

#### Objectives:
- This project uses Tableau to uncover the drivers behind customer churn in a telecom company, Databel, aiming to uncover insights about customer behavior.
- Understanding churn involves more than just knowing the churn rate; it requires identifying the root causes and devising strategies to reduce customer attrition.
- By leveraging Tableau's advanced features like calculated fields, dual-axis graphs, scatter plots, filters, and parameters, this analysis transforms raw data into actionable insights through compelling visual dashboards.

#### Data:
- The dataset contains information about customers(age,contract type, group plan etc) and their usage statistics(GB used, Length of contract etc) from a fictional company Databel.
- The dataset(CSV Files) was taken from Datacamp. 

#### Methods:
- Data was imported in Tableau Desktop first cleaned and checked for duplicate and missing values
- Different CSV files were joined based on Commaon cloumns.
- New Calculated fields and parameters were created
- Data was visualised in dashboards via heatmaps, scateer plots, column charts and scatter plots
- Interactive filets and parameters were included for easier analysis
- Dhasboard were formatted and included in a story.
- The story gives the stake holder a clear veiw of different plots and fghues and text fields to make beteer business decisions 

#### Results & Insights:
 - Total churn rate stands at 26.86%, with competitors offering better deals as the leading cause.
 - California exhibits the highest churn rate, predominantly among customers on month-to-month contracts.
 - Older customers are more prone to churn, whereas younger individuals and those in family/group plans show lower rates.
 - Customers often churn when they subscribe to plans they underutilize, resulting in higher perceived costs.
